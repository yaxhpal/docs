Hi Mayur,

As you know I am working on this issue, I have following understanding and doubts, and wanted to clarify them with you:

1. Total stock of DVDs is total number of DVDs at Bangalore Library whether issued, on shelf, damaged, withdrawn, lost or notforloan

2. Scanned items are those for which barcodes are given in provided txt file i.e. from DB point of view, which has datelastseen as stocktaking date

3. List of items issued out = Items which were on loan during stocktaking date and items which were issued before that date and are still on on loan

4. List of Items in library = Items excluding those which were issued out

5. Accession number is combination of item number and home branch code(?)

6. Items not scanned are those which are available in library but not scanned

7. Missing items are those which are marked missing in DB (? items.itemlost = 4 )

8. Duplicate titles are those which have same title and author name

9. Withdrawn items are those which are marked withdrawn in DB (?  items.wthdrawn =0)

10. Final list of DVDâ€™s available in library = Scanned items + on loan items - withdrawn - missing

11. Deletion of items which are not scanned (point 6) and missing (point 7)

12. Deletion of items ranging from 80001 to 82000 - Need more clarification on this

13. Final status update in Koha = marking scanned items as seen and deleting items not seen and missing

14. Total stock report and catalogue update  = Need few pointer on this such as what should such report include etc
