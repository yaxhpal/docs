Project environment for 'KohaTrac' created.

You may now configure the environment by editing the file:

  /opt/kohatrac/conf/trac.ini

If you'd like to take this new project environment for a test drive,
try running the Trac standalone web server `tracd`:

  tracd --port 8000 /opt/kohatrac

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8000/kohatrac.
There you can also browse the documentation for your installed
version of Trac, including information on further setup (such as
deploying Trac to a real web server).

The latest documentation can also always be found on the project
website:

  http://trac.edgewall.org/

Congratulations!
